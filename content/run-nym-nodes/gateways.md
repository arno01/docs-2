### Gateways

{{% notice info %}}
The Nym gateway was built in the [quickstart](/docs/quickstart). If you haven't yet built Nym and want to run the code, go there first.

Gateways provide a destination for mixnet packets. Most of the internet doesn't use encrypted Sphinx packets, so the gateway acts as a destination, sort of like a mailbox, for messages.

Peaps connect to gateways. Messages are automatically piped to connected clients and deleted from the gateway's disk storage. If a Peap client is offline when a message arrives, it will be stored for later retrieval. When the client connects, all messages will be delivered, and deleted from the gateway's disk. In release 0.8.0 we have now added end-to-end encryption, so gateways cannot see what they're storing for their users.

When it starts up, a Peap's client registers itself with a gateway, and the gateway returns an access token. The access token plus the gateway's IP can then be used as a form of addressing for delivering packets.

The default gateway implementation included in the Nym platform code holds packets for later retrieval. For many applications (such as chat), this is usable out of the box, as it provides a place that potentially offline clients can retrieve packets from. The access token allows clients to pull messages from the gateway node.

You can run the gateway from the top-level directory like this:

`./target/release/nym-gateway`

Output looks like this:

```shell
$ ./target/release/nym-gateway

`./target/release/nym-gateway init --help` shows available configuration options

#### Initializing a gateway

The `init` command sets up the gateway. You **must** supply 3 parameters:

1. `--id` a name for this gateway (determines where the config file will be saved, keep it to one word)
2. `--clients-host` needs to be an IPv4 or IPv6 address. This is the IP that the gateway will listen on for requests coming from Nym clients.
3. `--mix-host` needs to be an IPv4 or IPv6 address. This is the IP that the gateway will listen on for incoming Sphinx packets coming from the mixnet.

Example:

`./target/release/nym-gateway init --clients-host 82.32.45.6 --mix-host 82.32.45.6 --id supergateway` starts up a gateway node with default options, running on `82.32.45.6`. Note that you need to use an internet-addressable host ip. Gateways **must** also be capable of addressing IPv6. 


#### Running a gateway

The `run` command runs the gateway.

Example:

`./target/release/nym-gateway run --id supergateway`

Results in:

We are currently running only one gateway, and it's going to become a bottleneck in the network. If you are interested in running a gateway for the network, please let us know.
